- The network receives a set of inputs along with the corresponding correct outputs, and the algorithm learns by comparing its actual output with correct outputs to find errors. 
It then modifies the model accordingly. 

- commonly used in where historical data predicts future events

steps:

- data acquisition
- data cleaning
- split into train and test
- use training data to be fed into training model
- model testing
- adjust model parameters
- model deployment


- suggestion to train, validation, test data



- To fix this issue, data is often split into 3 sets
Training Data
Used to train model parameters
Validation Data
Used to determine what model hyperparameters to adjust
Test Data
Used to get some final performance metric



Evaluating performance for Classification
- accuracy, recall, precision and F1-score

- accuracy is useful when target classes are balances . i.e: equal number od datasets for cat and dog
- not a good choice if unbalanced (amount) class

recall 
- ability of a model to find all the relevant cases within dataset

precision:
- ability of a classification model to identify only relevant data points

f1-score
- relaionship betwen recall and precision


Evaluating regression model metric:

- MAE,MSE,RMSE

- MAE wont punish large errors, so use MSE, then RMSE ( it has same matric as MAE)
