- The network receives a set of inputs along with the corresponding correct outputs, and the algorithm learns by comparing its actual output with correct outputs to find errors. 
It then modifies the model accordingly. 

- commonly used in where historical data predicts future events

steps:

- data acquisition
- data cleaning
- split into train and test
- use training data to be fed into training model
- model testing
- adjust model parameters
- model deployment


- suggestion to train, validation, test data



- To fix this issue, data is often split into 3 sets
Training Data
Used to train model parameters
Validation Data
Used to determine what model hyperparameters to adjust
Test Data
Used to get some final performance metric
